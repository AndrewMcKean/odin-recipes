  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Are you also not American and have absolutely no idea what Hoppin' John is?!

    to Harvard College Dining Services so it's probably good!

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 and 1/2 cups vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1 cup long grain rice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cans black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cajun seasoning</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Method</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring broth and rice to boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and 
      simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed. This should take around 20
      -25 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until translucent,
      about 5-7 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in the rice, black-eyed peas, and Cajun seasoning.</li>
    <li>Cover the pot with a lid and cook until flavours blend, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Et voila! Dinner is served.</li>
  </ol>
